# Graphic-figures
Application for working with graphic figures
Personal project for OOP,Year 1,Software Engineering at Technical University of Sofia
The application provides a graphical interface for work (Windows Forms), and on the main form (the scene) the user can create multiple shapes.
The application enables interaction with the shapes (selecting, moving, deleting, and more). There is an option to calculate the area of the shapes depending on their sizes. The user has an opportunity to change the area (providing new window for the convenience of the user) and the colour of the figure.
The main form is divided by two sides facilitating the user and that way, all shapes on the left,center or on the right side can be selected(not one by one).
